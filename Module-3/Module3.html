            <h1>Introduction to the Arduino IDE and programming the ESP32</h1>
            <p>
                The ESP32 is a series of low-cost,low-power system on a chip microcontroller with integrated Wi-Fi and dual-mode Bluetooth.It is a successor to the ESP8266.It is majorly programmed in C/C++ but also supports Micropython.<br> Most times
                the Arduino IDE, which can program a variety of boards, is used to upload code to ESP32s.<br> The following are some of the features that make this board popular :
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Low-cost</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Low-power</strong> - It supports low-power mode states like deep sleep to save power in addition to it also consuming relatively little power.</li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Wi-Fi Capabilities </strong>- Operates in both wi-fi station mode or access point mode which are both used in Iot through web servers.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Bluetooth </strong>- Has bluetooth classic and Bluetooth Low Energy(BLE) which are bost used in Iot.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Dual-core</strong> - They come with 2Xtensa 32-bit LX6 microprocessors: core 0 and core 1.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Rich peripheral input/output interface -</strong> has numerous pins that can read or send data.</li>
                    <li><strong>Compatible with Arduino IDE</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Compatible with Micropython</strong></li>
                </ul>
