            <h1>Interfacing the RPi Pico with a Relay and RC522(RFID Module).</h1>
            <p>
                Here, we'll learn and understand first how an RFID(Radio Frequency Identification)Module works then proceed to use this knowlege to control the opening and closing of a relay.<br> An RFID system consists of 2 main parts, a<strong> tag</strong>                and a
                <strong> reader</strong><br> A tag is placed on the object to be identified while a reader is on the module.The reader consists of a radio frequency module and an antenna that generates a high frequency electromagnetic field while the
                reader is a passive device(doesn't require power) which consists of a microchip that stores and processes information and an antenna for receiving and transmitting a signal.<br> When the tag is brought close to the reader, the reader generates
                an electromagnetic field. This causes electrons to move through the tag&#39s antenna and subsequently powers the chip.<br> The chip then responds by sending its stored information back to the reader in the form of another radio signal.
                This is called a backscatter. The reader detects and interprets this backscatter and sends the data to a computer or microcontroller.<br>The above content describes the principle of operation of an RFID module when used as an <strong>Access
                    control System.</strong> <br> This module can also be used in other applications such as:
                <ul>
                    <li>Geolocation - When the tag is scanned by a smartphone, it opens a map and drops a pin at the specified coordinates.</li>
                    <li>Writing and Reading custom Data - The RFID module can store up to 143 text characters or a 10-digit number on a tag. The data is written to specific memory locations on the tag, referred to as slots. There are 36 slots numbered 0 to
                        35 that are safe to write to.This application is widely used in credit cards where when making payments, we swipe the card tag which is read(account balance) and deducted(Writing) as payment.</li>
                </ul>
                <br><br> After knowing the theory of its operating principle, let's learn about its pinout diagram<br>
                <div class="Pic">

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>VCC</strong> - supplies power to the module. This can be anywhere from 2.5 to 3.3 volts. You can connect it to the 3.3V output from your Microcontroller. But remember that connecting it to the 5V pin will probably destroy your
                        module!
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>RST</strong> - is an input for reset and power-down. When this pin goes low the module enters power-down mode. In which the oscillator is turned off and the input pins are disconnected from the outside world. Whereas the module
                        is reset on the rising edge of the signal.</li>
                    <li><strong>GND</strong> - is the ground pin and needs to be connected to the GND pin on the Microcontroller.</li>
                    <li><strong>IRQ</strong> - is an interrupt pin that alerts the microcontroller when an RFID tag is in the vicinity.</li>
                    <li><strong>MISO/SCL/Tx</strong> - pin acts as master-in-slave-out when SPI interface is enabled, as serial clock when I2C interface is enabled and as serial data output when the UART interface is enabled.</li>
                    <li><strong>MOSI (Master Out Slave In)</strong> - is the SPI input to the RC522 module.</li>
                    <li><strong>SCK(Serial Clock)</strong> - accepts the clock pulses provided by the SPI bus master i.e. Microcontroller.</li>
                    <li><strong>SS / SDA / Rx</strong> - pin acts as a signal input when the SPI interface is enabled, as serial data when the I2C interface is enabled and as a serial data input when the UART interface is enabled.</li>
                </ol><br> After understanding the pinout diagram, now its time to connect it to our RPi Pico and program it to read tags and configure it to accept certain tags and reject the rest.<br> Its code is as follows:<br>

            <h1>Types of Electric Door Locks in the Market.</h1>
            <p>Door locks have been in use for a large chunck of human civilization history as they offered simple ways to secure rooms with valuables inside. They were simple at first such as the Egyptian Tumbler Lock but gradually became more complex to
                the modern locks that use physical keys. As technology continued to advance, locks were invented that did not require physical keys to open. It began by using a physical code such as combinational locks then more recently we adopted the
                use of wireless codes(keys) sent via radio frequencies that can be read by an RFID reader used in the RFID access control.<br> Wireless keys are mostly used in Electric locks which are opened or closed by use of electrical energy.They
                come two configurations:
                <ul>
                    <li>Fail-safe: The lock unlocks when activated power is taken away from the lock.</li>
                    <li>Fail secure: The lock unlocks when activated power is transmitted to the lock.</li>
                </ul><br> Electronic locks also come with different voltages. Common power supply ratings for electronic door locks are:<strong>12V - 2A</strong> and <strong>24V - 1A.</strong>
                <br> .There exists various types of Electric Door Locks in the market today which include:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Electric strikes</strong>- They are mostly used in wooden or metallic doors (Not used with glass doors) and are the most affordable in terms of door security hardware.
                        <div class="Pic">
                            <img src="Pictures\electric-strike.webp">
                        </div>
                        They are operated by solenoids that shoot an element back or forth to unlock or lock a door.They are also convenient in that they can be configured to be fail safe or fail secure.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Magnetic Locks</strong> - They have no moving parts hence are perfect for use in glass doors and offices duu to their noiseless nature.</li>
                    <li><strong>Electrified push bars/Electronic exit bars</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Electrified mortise locks/Wired mortise locks</strong></li>
                    <li><strong></strong></li>
                    <li><strong></strong></li>
                    <li><strong></strong></li>
