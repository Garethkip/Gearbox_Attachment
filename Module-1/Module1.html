            <h1>Project Management and Documentation</h1>
            <p>
                Project management is the planning and organization of a company's resources to move a specific task, event, or duty toward completion.<br> Generally speaking, the project management process includes the following stages: planning, initiation,
                execution, monitoring, and closing.<br> This process is at times very bulky as one records every detail from start to completion but with the ever changing technology, now we have a tool in the form of a Version Control System known as
                Git and Github that are designed to allow collaboration between multiple people on the same project while at the same time recording all progress on a project.<br> During my time at Gearbox, I was exposed to these Version Control Systems
                through the recording of all my activities and projects on Github in the form of a website and code files that I would send to or update using Git and Github.<br> Now that we understand the general overview, what is Git and Github, what
                are thier differences and how do they work together.<br>
                <strong>GitHub</strong> is a cloud-based platform where you can work together with others to write code. In simple terms we can say it is in the form of a website or app or whatever platform that you use to collaborate.<br>
                <strong>Git </strong>is a version control system that intelligently tracks changes in files from an individual or many people collaborating on the same project.In simple terms we can say it is the brain that allows gitub to function.<br>                The two work together in that GitHub acts as the interface to the user while Git is the actual version controller working beneath the interface. Most of the time we use GitHub from our local machines through an integrated Development Environment
                such as VScode. To make this possible,we use commands on the terminal to tell Git what to do with our code or files. Let's Explore some of these commands and terms used on our Terminal:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Branching: </strong>It is the process of copying all the code into a new workspace in order to edit the code and test it without affecting the original code. Once all the changes have been made, this code is merged with the
                        master branch.</li>
                    <li><strong>Merging: </strong>It is the process of combining the main branch and the feature branch such that the main branch's content will be overwritten by the feature branch on code locations where differences exist.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Git Pull: </strong>It is the process of updating your code on your local machine by bringing down the changes of the code on GitHub to your local machine so that your code stays up to date as you work on it.</li>
                    <li><strong>Git Push: </strong>It is the process of sending your code to GitHub from your local machine in order to update the code on GitHub. It's the opposite of git pull</li>
                    <li><strong>Cloning: </strong>The process of copying a whole repositiory from GitHub into your local machine in order to personally(locally) work on it.</li>
                    <li><strong>Forking: </strong>It is the process of copying someone else's repository into your own repository. It's done on GitHub.</li>
                    <li><strong>Git add: </strong>The process of telling Git to stage your changes.(Track them)</li>
                    <li><strong>Git Commit: </strong>The process of attaching a message for each change you've made on your local code that you would wih to push to Github.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pull Request: </strong>Asking for approval from owner on repository to merge your feature branch to the main branch.</li>
                </ul>
                The git workflow can be summarized into:
                <ol>
                    <li>Write Code on local machine or Clone Repository then make changes on the code</li>
                    <li>Stage Changes(Git Add)</li>
                    <li>Git Commit-Commit the changes(Adding a message explaining them)</li>
                    <li>Push Changes to Github(Git push)</li>
                    <li>Make a pull request-Requst for merging</li>
                    <li>Merging-done on GitHub once all the changes have arrived.</li>
                </ol>
                The above describes how the entire doumentation process for the attachment period will be done.

            <h1>Introduction to embedded systems</h1>
            <p>
                <strong>Defination - </strong>An embedded system is a combination of computer hardware and software designed to perform a specific function.The software part of it refers to the device's firmware and inputed programmes that are a set ofinstructions
                on what the device is to do and the hardware refers to the physical aspect of the device such as sensors, processors and actuators.<br> Embedded Systems usually have a microprocessor chip or a microcontroller(a microprocessor with other
                peripherals such as storage) that facilitate processing of code.<br> The maincharacteristics of Embedded Systems include :
                <ol>
                    <li>typically, consist of hardware, software and firmware (Software that allows the hardware to function and communicate with the software which is fed into it)</li>
                    <li>Are embedded within a larger system to perform a specific function.</li>
                    <li>Can be either microprocessor-based or microcontroller-based -- both are integrated circuits that give the system computing power</li>
                    <li>Are often used for sensing and real-time computing in internet of things (IoT) devices, which are devices that are internet-connected and do not require a user to operate</li>
                    <li>Can vary in complexity and in function, which affects the type of software, firmware and hardware they use; and are often required to perform their function under a time constraint to keep the larger system functioning properly.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                Embedded systems vary in complexity but, generally, consist of three main elements:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Hardware -</strong> The hardware of embedded systems is based around microprocessors and microcontrollers. Microprocessors are very similar to microcontrollers and, typically, refer to a CPU (central processing unit) that
                        is integrated with other basic computing components such as memory chips and digital signal processors (DSPs). Microcontrollers have those components built into one chip.</li>
                    <li><strong>Software - </strong> and firmware. Software for embedded systems can vary in complexity. However, industrial-grade microcontrollers and embedded IoT systems usually run very simple software that requires little memory.</li>
                    <li><strong>Real-time operating system -</strong> These are not always included in embedded systems, especially smaller-scale systems. RTOSes define how the system works by supervising the software and setting rules during program execution.</li>
                </ol>
                In terms of hardware, a basic embedded system would consist of the following elements:
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Sensors - </strong>convert physical sense data into an electrical signal.</li>
                    <li><strong>Analog-to-digital (A-D) converters - </strong> change an analog electrical signal into a digital one.</li>
                    <li><strong>Processors - </strong>process digital signals and store them in memory.</li>
                    <li><strong>Digital-to-analog (D-A) converters - </strong>change the digital data from the processor into analog data.</li>
                    <li><strong>Actuators - </strong>compare actual output to memory-stored output and choose the correct one.</li>
                </ol>
